He's worked on making himself a better teammate and better communicator with the team. When Horner and Marko both commented in the past that Tsunoda was too angry on the radio, he worked on not pushing the button on his steering wheel to swear, knowing that he had become one of the TV directors' favorite characters."

If it's the latter, Red Bull could finally cut ties, doubt free, and promote Lawson or Isack Hadjar after a full year of seasoning, and turn to F2 prodigy Arvid Lindblad as the next big hope from the academy pipeline.
