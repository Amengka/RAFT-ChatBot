    "content": "An easy, and perhaps overly simplistic, way of explaining Red Bull's car design philosophy might be this: If he can drive it, we will build it. An obvious payoff has been four drivers' championships. A consequence of that reared its head last year, as the RB20 became more of a handful to drive, an erratic machine that even Verstappen grew to loathe by the summer. Sergio Pérez's form took a nosedive, and Red Bull lost the constructors' championship -- Verstappen was able to accumulate points he needed, while also winning brilliantly in places like Brazil, to take home his fourth straight individual title."

    "content": "Tsunoda was at the team's headquarters last week and drove this year's Red Bull in the driver-in-loop simulator. He said the car did not show any nasty traits in the virtual world, but admitted that might change when he hits the track in reality.\n\"I mean, in the simulator obviously it's not fully correct in terms of trickiness of the car, but at least it didn't feel crazy tricky,\" he said. \"I can feel what the drivers mentioned about the instability or lack of driving confidence."

    "content": "\"I did multiple set-ups that I wanted to try to make it better and those two days seemed pretty productive. I know what kind of direction I want to start and it seems to be a good baseline in terms of overall performance. So yeah, it was a really good simulator session.\"\nAsked if he'd had any words of advice from Verstappen, Tsunoda added: \"I think even if I tapped his shoulder and asked about the car, I don't think he's going to say the truth, you know?"

    "content": "\"So I just try to discover it myself in the data, how he's driving, also on onboard videos. I already checked multiple videos from him in the last two grand prix.\n\"Like I said, I didn't feel the trickiness yet - the clear trickiness of the car. I'll feel it myself, and I'm sure it also depends on driving style. It will behave a little bit different.\"}"
